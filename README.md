# Minishell Implementation Notes

-It Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
-It Have a working history.
-It Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
-It Handle â€™ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quoted sequence.
-It Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
-Redirections : >, <, >>, <<
-It Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
-It handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
-It handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline
-It handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
 -In interactive mode:
  -ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
  -ctrl-D exits the shell.
  -ctrl-\ does nothing.
-It implemented the following builtins:
 -echo with option -n
 -cd with only a relative or absolute path
 -pwd with no options
 -export with no options
 -unset with no options
 -env with no options or arguments
 -exit with no options
